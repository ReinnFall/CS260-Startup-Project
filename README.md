# CS260-Startup-Project
My goal in this startup is to make a working string generator for popular mobile game Pokemon Go.

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
If you have ever played Pokemon Go, you know how fun it is to catch and collect your favorite creatures. You also know how tedious and time consuming it can be to sort through your hundreds of Pokemon. With this website you will be able to skip that agonizing part and get right back to playing. This website will give you  the ability to quickly create, save and copy other's seach strings.

### Key Features
- Ability to create general search strings that include commonly used filters such as:
  - Shiny
  - Legendary
  - Mythical
  - Traded
  - Lucky
  - Dynamax
  - Gigantamax
  - Purified
  - Shadow
  - 4 Star
  - 3 Star
  - Hatched
- Ability to create very specific transfer commands (pick specifically which pokemon to include in each string)
- Ability to save your strings on a personal profile
- Ability to view strings others have made and be able to save/copy them
